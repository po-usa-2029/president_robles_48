<br>
The last four years has proven to be a most illuminating experience...
<br>
<br>
Shortly after announcing his intention to run for President of the United States,
Robles was forced out of his job, prevented from getting legal representation,
placed on a do-not-hire list, evicted from his apartment, and eventually forced
into the NYC shelter system, a prison like environment, where he was abused, harrassed,
humiliated, threatened, stalked, on an almost daily basis, and almost killed on several
occassions, without ever speaking to a judge.
<br>
<br>
For 28 months, the criminal syndicate targeted him everywhere he went;
Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Bronx. So, he decided
to do something about it.
<br>
<br>
Robles starts his political career by developing a kind of muscular position of public authority,
for the purposes of putting down the kind of illicit corruption, of which every mayoral agency is
part of.
<br>
<br>
He wants to take on the most dangerous, and powerful man in New York City. The bully of all bullies (a.k.a. The Eagle Slayer).
<br>
<br>
Eric Adams is quite ruthless in dealing with his adversaries, in terms of doing them in,
creating scandal around them, or physically harming them, and so Robles has all of these things to fear.
<br>
<br>
But he is determined to not let it phase him.
<br>
<br>
Robles wants to achieve the impossible here:
<br>
<br>
-- schedule a court date in NYS Supreme Court Civil, and WIN.
<br>
-- schedule a court date in NYS Supreme Court Criminal, and WIN.
<br>
-- and run for President of the United States, in 2028, and WIN.
